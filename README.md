# Countries
Countries and their other informations

	I used a lot of things in this project.
	For example MVVM, Retrofit, RxJava, SQLite, Room, Glide with extensions, Navigation, Swipe Refresh Layout and advanced Shared Preferences.

	I used all of them in my previous applications, but in this project I used them in more detail and all together.
